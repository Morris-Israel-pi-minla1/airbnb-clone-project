|Page                       | Description                                                    |Key Elements                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Property Listing View** | Grid/list of available properties with filters and sorting     | Search bar, filters, property cards                |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Full property details with images, amenities, and booking form | Image carousel, description, amenities, map        |
| **Simple Checkout View**  | Final booking step: user details + payment                     | Booking summary, payment form, confirmation button |

## 💡 Importance of User-Friendly Design

 A well-designed booking system reduces friction, increases conversions, and improves customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design are essential.

## 👥 Project Roles and Responsibilities

Building a full-stack application requires collaboration across multiple disciplines. Each role contributes to the overall success of the project:

| Role              | Key Responsibilities |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| **Project Manager** | Oversees project timeline, coordinates team efforts, manages deliverables, and ensures milestones are met. |
| **Frontend Developers** | Implement responsive UI components, ensure cross-browser compatibility, and maintain accessibility standards (WCAG). |
| **Backend Developers** | Build REST/GraphQL APIs, design database schemas, implement authentication, and manage business logic. |
| **Designers (UI/UX)** | Create wireframes and prototypes in Figma, define design systems, and ensure intuitive user experiences. |
| **QA/Testers** | Write and execute test cases, perform unit/integration testing, and report bugs to ensure quality. |
| **DevOps Engineers** | Set up CI/CD pipelines, manage server infrastructure, monitor deployments, and ensure application scalability. |
| **Product Owner** | Defines project requirements, prioritizes feature backlog, and represents stakeholders’ needs. |
| **Scrum Master** | Facilitates Agile ceremonies (sprints, retros), removes blockers, and ensures effective team communication. |

## 🧩 UI Component Patterns

To ensure consistency and reusability across the application, we will design and implement the following core UI components:
--
### 🔝 Navbar
- Logo  
- Search bar (location, date, guests)  
- User navigation (login, profile, bookings)  
- Responsive hamburger menu for mobile  

### 🏡 Property Card
- Property image
- Title & short description
- Price per night & location
- Rating (stars/reviews)
- Favorite (wishlist) button
- Responsive grid layout

### 📄 Footer
- Site navigation links (About, Careers, Help)
- Company information
- Social media links
- Copyright information

---

### 📌 Why UI Component Patterns Matter
Defining reusable UI patterns ensures:
- **Consistency** across all pages

- **Efficiency** by reusing code rather than duplicating

- **Scalability** as new features/pages are added

- **Maintainability** with a structured component-based architecture
